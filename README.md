I implemented React in my program as my modification.

In my program I created a to-do list website similar to the one described in the assignment instructions from assignment a2. I recreated the program from scratch instead of porting my a2 assignment, the changes in styling and functionality made it simpler to just recreate it completely.

You can choose the name, priority, and start date for each task. When a task is added, the list updated dynamically. You can Add, Edit, and Delete tasks, and a user can only see tasks associated with their account.

I've used MongoDB as instructed and hosted my project on Glitch. The authentication functions I used are Passport Local and GitHub authentication.
