I implemented React in my program as my modification. My hosting service does not allow link changes so my hosting link is random.

In my program I created a to-do list website similar to the one described in the assignment instructions from assignment a2.
You can choose the name, priority, and start date for each task. When a task is added, the list updated dynamically. You can Add, Edit, and Delete tasks, and a user can only see tasks associated with their account.

I've used MongoDB as instructed and hosted my project on Glitch. The authentication functions I used are Passport Local and GitHub authentication.
